# akteerimine
## Quickstart
```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/activemq.yml up -d

npm install

./gradlew -x webapp
npm start
```

## Project Structure

Node is required for generation and recommended for development. `package.json` is always generated for a better development experience with prettier, commit hooks, scripts and so on.

`/src/*` structure follows default Java structure.

- `npmw` - wrapper to use locally installed npm.
- `/src/main/docker` - Docker configurations for the application and services that the application depends on

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

```
npm install
```

We use npm scripts and [Angular CLI][] with [Webpack][] as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

```
./gradlew -x webapp
npm start
```

Npm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `npm update` and `npm install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `npm help update`.

The `npm run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

```typescript
ServiceWorkerModule.register('ngsw-worker.js', { enabled: false })
```

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the akteerimine application for production, run:

```
./gradlew -Pprod clean bootJar
```

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

```
java -jar build/libs/*.jar
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) in your browser.

### Packaging as war

To package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:

```
./gradlew -Pprod -Pwar clean bootWar
```

## Using Docker to simplify development
For example, to start a postgresql database in a docker container, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d
```

To stop it and remove the container, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml down
```

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

```
npm run java:docker
```
